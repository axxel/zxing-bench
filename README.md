# zxing-bench

This is a little experiment related to my latest effort of bringing
[zxing-cpp](https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp) to non-c++ communities.
The purpose is to 'show off' and convince people that giving this library
a shot might be worth it.

So far there are
  * [Rust](rust/README.md)
  * [.NET](dotnet/README.md)
